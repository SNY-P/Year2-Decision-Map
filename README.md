# Year 2: Decision Map Coursework

This was a coursework that was undertaken during my second year of university. It is an android application created in Android Studio and Java. The DecisionMap and DecisionNode Java classes were provided, however they were tweaked to suit the developed application. The program works by reading off of a CSV file.
